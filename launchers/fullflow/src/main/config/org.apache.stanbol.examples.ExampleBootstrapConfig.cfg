# The filename defines the config PID.

# Factory configs should be named like foo.bar-X.cfg 
# whereo.foo.bar is the factory PID and X a unique value
# for that PID. The actual config PID is then automatically 
# generated PID, and the value of X is stored as an alias 
# property in the configuration.
